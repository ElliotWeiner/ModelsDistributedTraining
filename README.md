This is a repo for me to experiment with distributed training. Thus far I have implemented Ray (OpenAI standard) for training on BU's 4-GPU remote cluster, which requires ssh access and linked ports. I then compared basic operations on the CPU versus cluster, model training on the CPU verus cluster, and then different models on cluster training. I am currently adapting a hybrid model (CNN plus ViT) for segmentation models. My goal is a light-weight segmentation model with SOTA performance, easily adaptable for edge ML.
